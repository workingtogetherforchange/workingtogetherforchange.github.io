            At Working Together for Change, our end goal is to end homelessness, one person at a time. Initially, when our co-founders Nitish and Aditya Sood began their work against homelessness, they quickly noticed there was quite a lot of work being done by many fantastic organizations – but nothing really included the students. Working Together for Change is a student-led nonprofit that serves as a platform to leverage this key demographic – students – to help end homelessness.              </p>

                <h2 style="color:white;font-size: 40px">WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</h2>
                <p>There are nearly 7,000 homeless people in Atlanta. They face many challenges—how to stay warm, where to stay at night, or where to get food. One challenge that many of us don’t even consider is—where to put their belongings.</p>

                <p>Often times, homeless people are forced to put all their belongings into one small bag or whatever else they can find. A lot of times, they use shopping carts they’ve found, or even trash bags. Unfortunately, city cleaning and other city services mistake these for trash and throw away the collection of all of the homeless’s belongings! Imagine if you had to carry everything you owned with you wherever you went.</p>

                <p>People can’t even go to their jobs without the worry that their entire life’s belongings might be accidentally thrown away!</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;font-size: 40px">OUR SOLUTION</h2>
                <p>Together, we can collectively work to change that. WTFC strives to reduce the burden that these people carry by donating backpacks. A backpack may not mean much to us but it can be a big deal to someone in need. If you have one bag, I have a bag, and our friends have bags, together we can give the homeless a place for their belongings.</p>

                <p>That is one basic need we want to address. You may have a lot of discarded bags at home—I know I did when I started out a few months ago—we had a lot of bags that we took to work or here and there and we had bought a new one. The old unused bags were lying in an old carton in the basement—seeing an opportunity, I also reached out to some of my friends and they shared similar stories.</p>

                <p>We started collecting and soon we had 20 bags among 5 friends. We filled them up with other items like old jackets, toiletries, some cereal bars, a water bottle, and a book. When we gave them out to those who needed them, it was amazing to see their eyes lit up just looking at the bags. That was obviously something they could use immediately! Surprisingly, they loved the books and many spent more time browsing an old Harry Potter I put in the bag than looking at the clothes.</p>

                <p>A typical backpack consists of a watertight gallon-size zipper lock plastic bag filled with items like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>List of local resources (food bank, shelter, clothing, healthcare, etc)</li>

                <p>the Silicon Valley Chapter of WTFC went to Mexico to build a house for a family. Over the course of four days, we traveled down to Tijuana, built a home, and settled a family in it. This year, we join 10 families from Aug. 12th– 15th to make this house a reality for a family.</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;font-size: 40px">OUR PLAN</h2>
                <p>All lodging, food, and local transportation costs are shared among all the participants.</p>

                <p>In 4 days, we complete building the entire house from cutting wood, building walls, painting, decorating, and furnishing!</p>

                <p>The best part is the giant smile on the faces of the family and the children!</p>
